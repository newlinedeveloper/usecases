## Blockchain Usecases


### Usecase 1 : Crypto Wallet

A crypto wallet is a digital wallet that allows individuals to securely store, manage, and transfer their cryptocurrencies. A crypto wallet contains a public key and a private key, which are used to send and receive cryptocurrencies on the blockchain network.


### Usecase 2 : Blockchain Payment Gateway

A blockchain payment gateway is a platform that enables merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments from their customers. It provides a way for merchants to receive payments in cryptocurrency, which are then converted into fiat currency and deposited into the merchant's bank account.




### Usecase 3 : Letter of credit Smart contract

A letter of credit (LOC) is a financial instrument that is commonly used in international trade to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers. It is a guarantee from a financial institution, such as a bank, that the buyer will pay the seller a specified amount of money upon presentation of certain documents, such as proof of shipment or delivery of goods.


### Usecase 4 : Blockchain File storage

Blockchain file storage is a decentralized method of storing files using blockchain technology. It allows users to store and share files securely and privately without the need for a centralized server or storage provider.


### Usecase 5 : Crypto currency trading Exchange

A cryptocurrency trading exchange is a platform that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, as well as exchange one cryptocurrency for another. Cryptocurrency trading exchanges are similar to stock exchanges, but instead of trading stocks, users trade cryptocurrencies.
